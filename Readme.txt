== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Installation Instructions =

1. Go to the HubSpot WooCommerce Settings page and Enable the integration. 
2. Enable the logging of each API request. 
3. Save the settings.
4. Next, click on the authorize button on the setting page. 
5. After successful authentication of OAuth 2.0, click on Run Setup.
6. And you are done! The groups and their associated properties are uploaded to HubSpot along with a cron.
7. Any updated information is pushed to HubSpot through the cron.

= Details are not syncing instantly =

We provide the updating in every 5 minutes. However, HubSpot takes some time to reflect the properties. There are the few points you can crosscheck:

- Please update the integration with the latest version.
- Check API logs.
- Please contact us, if still facing issues.

=  I just installed your plugin and am wondering if there is a sync of HubSpot contact details to the WooCommerce user database since this is the missing link I search for most. Is there anything else that I need to set up to get this working? =

There is no extra setup needed as the updated information is synced with Hubspot within 5 minutes. 

The plugin only updates the field data that are created. If you feel some extra fields or other data is needed, please feel free to contact us.
